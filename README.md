# ChatBot

## How I made JokeBot

I turned the baseline chatbot into a JokeBot. It now tells the user jokes, asks them what they think about the jokes, and responds accordingly. I created conditional branches where based on user responses to the jokes, the bot would either respond positively or negatively. I also added a variable for saving the user's name so it can be referenced again later.
